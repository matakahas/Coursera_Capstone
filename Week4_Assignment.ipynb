    "In this project, I will implement a system that recommends neighborhoods to move in based on the preferences of a person looking for an apartment. People pick a neighborhood to live in for different reasons (affordability, distance to their work or school, etc.), but one factor that a lot of them consider is whether the neighborhood has certain types of stores or places nearby that they like. For instance, a person might want to live in a neighborhood with lots of good restaurants, or another person might want a park close to their place. I am thus planning to create a system that could be used on an online apartment marketplace (like [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/)) that gathers information about different neighborhoods in a city via Foursquare location data, asks the customer what kind of stores or places they want their place to be close to, and pushes neighborhood recommendations based on the preferences. Although realistically customers should be able to choose which city they live in, I will focus on the city of Seattle, where I spent a year and I would LOVE to go back there one day! "

In order to tie each neighborhood with a specific longitude and latitude, I will use google map to look up each neighborhood and write down their longitude and latitude. Although this is a tedious step, I believe this will not be too time-consuming for one city. Besides, I could not find any datasets that display both geographical information such as zip codes and neighborhood names in Seattle, along with their average rent.\n",

The data enables us to search for a specific type of venues around a given location, learn more about the specific venues such as the tips provided by Foursquare users, and explore trending venues around a given location. I will mostly use the last feature in order to figure out what type of venues one can expect the most from each neighborhood, and make recommendations accordingly."
